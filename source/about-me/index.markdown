My name is Andy Wang and currently I'm a senior Ruby on Rails developer at Adelaide, Australia. I have 9 years of Java and Jave EE experience, however I'm very enthusiastic on Ruby. I advocate continuous integration and delivery strongly. And also I'm fond of reading source code of high quality open source projects such as Rack, Ruby on Rails, capistrano etc. Having worked in several different countries such as China, France, Singapore and Australia, I can adapt to different working environments and cultures quickly. During my spare time I like reading books, especially programming and investing books.

My contacts are as following,
